I've always found game engines to be fascinating. I started this project with the sole intent of learning the ins-and-outs of game engine development.

Here's what is done so far:
| Feature | Status |

| Main game loop | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Behavioral scripting | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Basic rendering | :x: |
| Basic physics | :x: |
| Basic audio | :x: |
| Basic networking | :x: |
